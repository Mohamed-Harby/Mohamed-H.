      <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
      <p>
        A 24-year-old fresh graduate software engineer located in Giza, Egypt.
        Started coding when I was 12 🏃🏼 and graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's
        degree in computer engineering.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently I'm doing my milatiry service and still have three months
        remaining to finish 🏃🏼‍➡️. During vacations, I work hard to keep on
        track, preserve my prior accomplishments, and prepare myself for the
        market.
        <br />
        <br />
        Interested in web development, particularly the backend stack. I
        selected Java as my tech stack because it allows me to work with large
        systems and study sophisticated computer science concepts, which I
        enjoy.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy tackling code challenges. Actually, I spend a significant
        amount of time practicing competitive programming with various online
        judges.
